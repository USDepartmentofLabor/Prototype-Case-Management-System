{{ user.name or user.username }},

User "{{ changed_role_user.name or changed_role_user.username }}" role was
changed from a role with the "ASSIGNABLE_TO_CASE" permission  to a role
without the permission. Therefore all cases that were assigned to this
user have been unassigned. The cases affected include:

{% for case in cases %}
* {{ case.name }} - {{ web_app_url }}/cases/{{ case.id }}
{% endfor %}
