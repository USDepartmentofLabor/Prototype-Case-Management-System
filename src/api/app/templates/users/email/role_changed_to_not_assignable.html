<p>User "{{ changed_role_user.name or changed_role_user.username }}" role was
    changed from a role with the "ASSIGNABLE_TO_CASE" permission to a role
    without the permission. Therefore all cases that were assigned to this
    user have been unassigned. The cases affected include:</p>
<ul>
{% for case in cases %}
    <li><a href="{{ web_app_url }}/cases/{{ case.id }}">{{ case.name }}</a></li>
{% endfor %}
</ul>
