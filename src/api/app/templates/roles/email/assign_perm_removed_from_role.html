<p>{{ user.name or user.username }},</p>
<p>
The "ASSIGNABLE_TO_CASE" permission was removed from the role
"{{ role.name }}". Therefore all cases that were assigned to users
that had the role were unassigned. The cases affected include:</p>
<ul>
{% for case in cases %}
    <li><a href="{{ web_app_url }}/cases/{{ case.id }}">{{ case.name }}</a></li>
{% endfor %}
</ul>
