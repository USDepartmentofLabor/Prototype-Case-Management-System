{{ user.name or user.username }},

The role "{{ role.name }}" was deleted from the system which had the
"ASSIGNABLE_TO_CASE" permission and the default role does not have
that permission. Therefore the cases that were assigned to users
that had the role were unassigned. The cases affected include:

{% for case in cases %}
* {{ case.name }} - {{ web_app_url }}/cases/{{ case.id }}
{% endfor %}
