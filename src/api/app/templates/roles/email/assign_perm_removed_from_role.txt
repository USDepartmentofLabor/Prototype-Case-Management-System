{{ user.name or user.username }},

The "ASSIGNABLE_TO_CASE" permission was removed from the role
"{{ role.name }}". Therefore all cases that were assigned to users
that had the role were unassigned. The cases affected include:

{% for case in cases %}
* {{ case.name }} - {{ web_app_url }}/cases/{{ case.id }}
{% endfor %}
